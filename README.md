# Horiseon Landing page

## Description

This is an example of a Landing page created purely with CSS and html. This webpage was build in order to practice writing and cleaning up CSS and HTML Code. Throughout working on this project I have learnt how to better optimize my code to not have less repeating lines, as well as to use proper html tags to achieve my desired goal.
